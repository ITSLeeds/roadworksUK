## Abstract

This presentation reports on the findings and outcomes of a three-month study funded by the RAC Foundation, based on data provided by Elgin, a company which hosts the website https://roadworks.org.
The main findings on the number and type of works demonstrate the diversity of reporting conventions accross the UK, highlighting the potential for harmonisation. We'll also touch on data on 'Section 58 Restrictions'; traffic disruptions (thanks to data from TomTom); and  visitors to the roadworks.org website.
The presentation will culminate in a live demo of the R package **roadworksUK**, software we wrote for the project.

This shows us 3 things about road works: ubiquity (caused by fact roads are used for lots more than transport); impact on road users; and wider impacts.

- Section58 Restrictions (New Roads and Street Works Act 1991) place a temporary ban on planned roadworks in a specific street or area.

- High geographical variability in uptake

- Some 'early adopters'

- Restrictions not reported in some areas

- Others (Shropshire and Sheffield for example) have issued over a 1,000 new restrictions in 18 months to 1 July 2018

# Live demo

- Who has heard of 'R' (before today)?

- Who understands this?:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ITSLeeds/roadworksUK")
```

- Bad news: it's a *programming language*

]

.pull-right[

- Good news: it's free

- And increasingly easy to use

- Thanks to innovations like RStudio:
